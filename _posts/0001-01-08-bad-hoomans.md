### Frantic, freaky, fun
<div class="box">
  <p>
    <i>You are Mister Wu, the friendly neighborhood ghost. Mister Wu resides in the local cemetery, working hard to sell his dumplings to other undead travelers. You only occasionally haunt the residents of nearby towns for fun, but you’ve never touched a living soul, and certainly never taken one. One day, your fellow ghosts stopped showing up and you hear footsteps approaching. A group of hoomans show up, calling themselves “adventurers”, and try to destroy your dumpling shop. Now you must REPAIR your defences and survive as long as you can.</i>

    This game was made in 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2020 in Vancouver. The theme was Repair. We made it using Unity and all the assets were created from scratch. My role in this project was gameplay programmer.
