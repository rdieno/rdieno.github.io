### Unfamiliar Terrain

    A crash landing has scattered your ship parts across the planetside, you must brave an unfamiliar terrain and dangerous enemies to collect the parts and repair your ship in order to escape.

    This project was created in C++ using a custom engine for the course COMP 8551 at BCIT during the Games Development bachelors program. The target platform was windows and our team included 4 people. My challenge in this project was to incorporate parallel processing. I decided to parallelize enemy pathfinding on the GPU using OpenCL with the A* search algorithm.
