    This game is a metaphor-rich infinite runner. The player can jump, duck and side-step to avoid obstacles and collect power-ups. This project targeted iOS and was mostly written in Swift with OpenGL ES. My role was programming movement and to implement the Bullet Physics SDK for collision detection. Since bullet is written in C++, I had to create the interface between our Swift code and the C++ Bullet SDK code.
