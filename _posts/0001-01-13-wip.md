### Snowboard Character Controller
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Early WIP of my snowboard game in Unreal Engine 5.2 using <a target="_blank" href="https://angelscript.hazelight.se/">Angelscript</a> for all the logic. Currently movement, jumping and spins are implemented, along with some basic procedural animation using Unreal's Control Rig. The end goal is to flesh this out a bit more into a full game with grabs, rail tricks and combos.

### Character Movement Simulation
<div class="box">
  <p>
    A demonstration of character movement separation using a simple partial boid simulation in Unreal Engine 5.2 and C++. The characters in this demo attempt to avoid each other without using physics collision. There are two teams, each team chases the ball matching their own colour.

### Unreal Engine Custom Navigation Links
<div class="box">
  <p>
    This demo shows various ways in which broken sections of the navigation mesh can be navigated in Unreal Engine 5.2 and C++. Jump down is available by default in Unreal, the rest of the logic along with playing the animations has been implemented by me. Animation assets are from Mixamo and retargeted to Unreal's Mannequin.
